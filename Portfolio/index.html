          <h3>Design + Development</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently learning, how to design and develop websites, to
            design the websites, I use Figma as that is the software, I am most
            comfortable with. To develop websites, I use Visual Studio Code, as
            it is my preferred code editor.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have been using Visual Studio code for some time now, am familiar
            with the software, as well as having all my extensions makes, the
            experience enjoyable, developing in Visual Studio Code.

          <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
          <p>
            I always wanted to know how websites were made, what happened every
            time I filled out a form online, why some websites looked appealing
            and why others did not, these were questions that always fascinated
            me.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is when I discoverd what HTML, CSS and Javascript can do when
            used together well.

          <h3>C++</h3>
          <p>
            C++ was created in the early 1980's and is a general purpose, object
            oriented programming language. it supports generic programming as
            well as low level memory manipulation.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is no secret C++ has influenced many other programming languages.
            including C# and Java, one can argue how would programming languages
            look like, if it was not for C++.

        <p>
          From a young age, I have always been fascinated with computers, I
          always wanted to learn, how they work, what makes do the things, they
          do.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I always took my IT lesson's very seriously. At the age 16 my
          parents asked me to make them a website, which I had no idea, how to
          make. But as I was the IT guy in my family, they assumed, it was
          nothing I could not figure out.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I started learning about web design, using free online resources, I
          could get hands on. That is when my passion for web design was
          realised. The final website was nothing special, but it served it's
          purpose. I have always been fascinated with professional looking
          websites, I am working towards that level, where I can design and
          build, beautiful professional websites.
